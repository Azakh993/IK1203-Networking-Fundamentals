# Course contents
This repository documents the produced code in the Networks and Communication course offered by KTH, covering various aspects of networking including Web and Email, Basic Internet Services, Network Addressing and Routing, and Socket Programming.

## Web and Email:

* Understanding the structure of the Internet and its components.
* Layered network models: overview of the Internet model.
* Communication models: "Client-server" and "peer-to-peer".
* Internet-based applications and their protocols: DNS, SMTP, HTTP etc.
* Design and implementation of applications according to the client/server model.
* Socket programming.

## Basic Internet Services:

* Principles of transport protocols and the services they offer.
* Internet-based transport protocols: TCP and UDP.
* Flow regulation, congestion control and error handling.
* Stop-and-wait, Go-Back-N as well as window handling and congestion control in TCP.

## Network Addressing and Routing:

* Interconnected networks: Internet Protocol (IP), datagram services, packet switching, routing protocols and routing algorithms.
* Local area networks: topologies, access control, Ethernet, wireless local area networks, switched local area networks, link protocols. Network in data centers.
* Detection of transmission errors.

## Socket Programming:

* Use of socket programming to implement simple applications according to the client/server model.
* Design, implementation and analysis of the behaviour of simple Internet-based applications and their protocols.
* Design and configuration of simpler networks with basic services such as DHCP and DNS.
* Explanation of different functions and concepts concerning equipment for communication and networks.
* Calculation or estimation of performance in terms of delay, throughput and utilization in interconnected networks.
